## Frequently Asked Questions

In general, if facing issues, please first [run WP in debug mode](https://codex.wordpress.org/Debugging_in_WordPress).

*I installed the plugin, but installation failed after pressing Complete Installation, showing me a text in a red rectangle?*

Cause: Either the cURL extension or certain cURL functions are disabled on your server or your hosting blocks API calls to the Kaltura servers.

Solution 1: Enable curl and its functions on the server (or have the hosting company enable it for you).

Solution 2: Remove any blocking of external calls from the server.

*I can’t activate the plugin, it presents an error message after clicking Activate on the plugin list*
It might be caused due to an old version of PHP.

The Kaltura WP plugin is written for PHP5 with the use of classes and static members, these are not supported on earlier versions of PHP.

Upgrade to PHP5 or later. If upgrading doesn't solve this issue or you already have PHP5 on your server, post the error information on the [forum](https://forum.kaltura.org) and we'll help you.

## Join the Kaltura Community and Contribute to Open Source Video

Creative potential, innovation, and competition all correlate directly with the balance of freedoms and constraints we face in sharing, manipulating, finding, and watching video. For instance, to create remixes or mash-ups, video artists need access to the original materials in order to reformulate their new work. In an ideal world, everyday users will be able to easily copy and paste portions of video, as they already can with text. Of course the benefits of a more open system will go far beyond remixing, cutting, and pasting - when open video standards and formats are widely embraced, it will be possible to index, search, and access the medium much as we do text. This will be the real revolution for video.

Kaltura is a founding member of the Open Video Alliance, a group of organizations, developers, creators, and academics all striving to foster the open-source online video revolution.  We invite the entire community to join us in building the first open-source platform for interactive and collaborative video. We look forward to your input, feedback, time, and support.
